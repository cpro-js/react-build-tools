# Generator UI5 React

Scaffolds a complete React.js app based on [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/)
and [Craco (CRA Configuration Override)](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco) to further customize the build,
in order to realize a tight Fiori Launchpad integration.

Uses [UI5 Web Components for React](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents-react/).
